# 🎓 42 School Journey - [Your GitHub Username]

Welcome to my **42 School** repository! This repository tracks my progress, projects, and achievements as I dive deep into software development over the next three years. Here, you'll find everything from the **42 Piscine** (the intensive bootcamp) to my ongoing projects as I progress through the **Cursus**. This journey is a testament to growth, challenges, and mastery in computer science.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized to reflect my progress through 42, with a clear folder structure:

42

├── Piscine        # Completed intensive bootcamp projects and exercises

└── Cursus         # Projects from the main curriculum, organized by year and level

### Folders:
- **Piscine**: Contains all my work and completed exercises from the **Piscine** bootcamp, a challenging 4-week immersion into the fundamentals of programming.
- **Cursus**: This is the main 42 curriculum folder. As I progress, I will store each project here by year, allowing an organized view of my growth and increasing complexity in skills.

## 🌟 Current Projects

### Piscine
The **Piscine** was a rigorous introduction to programming, focusing on foundational concepts in **C** and **UNIX** environments. I'm proud to have completed it successfully, and I am now equipped with fundamental programming skills to tackle the **Cursus**!

| Project         | Description                           | Status     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Shellxx**     | Basic UNIX and shell command mastery  | ✅ Completed |
| **Cxx**         | Intro to C and handling basic syntax  | 🟨 Almost Completed |
| **Rushes**      | Collaborative coding challenges       | 🟨 Almost Completed |

### Cursus
This folder contains my ongoing and upcoming projects over the next three years. Each project helps deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and beyond.

#### Year 1
| Project     | Description                                 | Status       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **libft**   | Custom implementation of standard C library | 🚧 In Progress |

> **Note**: I'll update this section as I progress through each project in the **Cursus**.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: C, C++, Python (future), Shell
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS
